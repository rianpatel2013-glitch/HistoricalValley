  "response": "Valley Ranch refers to two prominent master-planned communities in Texas, each with its own distinct history: one in Irving and another near Houston in Porter.\n\n**Valley Ranch in Irving, Texas**\nThe land that is now Valley Ranch in Irving was formerly open ranch land, much like the rest of Irving. The community is a master-planned development, carefully designed, and gets its name because it sits below a large ridge, giving it the appearance of a valley.\n\nThe development of Valley Ranch began to accelerate in the 1980s. In the 1970s, as the I-635 loop was being built around Dallas, local Irving officials started planning how to best utilize the land north of the new interstate. The connection of Highways 121 and I-635 in the 1980s spurred a significant boom in the area, leading to the construction of new homes and businesses that continued into the 2010s.\n\nA critical aspect of Valley Ranch's history is the establishment of the Irving Flood Control District Section III (IFCD 3) in 1983. Much of the ranch land was located in the Trinity River floodplain, posing a flood risk. IFCD 3 was commissioned by the Texas Legislature to design and construct an extensive levee system and a network of waterways, water holding facilities, pumps, and sluice gates to manage excess water. This flood control system made the area safe for development and eliminated the need for property owners to purchase expensive federal flood insurance.\n\nValley Ranch was once notable for hosting the practice facilities of the Dallas Cowboys football team, starting in 1985, and the Dallas Stars hockey team. Both teams have since relocated to Frisco, Texas.\n\n**Valley Ranch in Porter, Texas**\nThe Valley Ranch community in Porter, Texas, began its development around 2006. It is a 1,400-acre master-planned community near Houston, strategically located at the intersection of Interstate 69 (US Highway 59) and The Grand Parkway (99).\n\nThe vision for this Valley Ranch was to create a vibrant mixed-use community, encompassing residential, retail, entertainment, office, and medical facilities. Since its inception, the single-family residential component has been fully built out. The Villas at Valley Ranch, a multi-family residence, opened in 2008, and The Pointe at Valley Ranch Town Center, a luxury apartment community, opened in 2019. The community also features the 240-acre Valley Ranch Town Center, offering shopping, dining, and entertainment, as well as The Grove, a 135-acre nature preserve with lakes and trails. Additionally, civic components like the New Caney ISD Randall Reed Stadium and Little League Football fields are part of the development.Valley Ranch refers to two distinct master-planned communities in Texas, each with its own history.\n\n**Valley Ranch in Irving, Texas**\nThe area known as Valley Ranch in Irving was originally open ranch land, similar to much of Irving's early landscape. The name \"Valley Ranch\" derives from its former use as a working cattle ranch and its location below a large ridge, giving it the appearance of a valley.\n\nThe development of Valley Ranch as a master-planned community gained momentum in the 1980s. Planning for the utilization of land north of the newly constructed I-635 began in the 1970s. The connection of highways 121 and I-635 in the 1980s significantly spurred growth, leading to a surge in the construction of homes and businesses that continued into the 2010s.\n\nA pivotal moment in Valley Ranch's history was the creation of the Irving Flood Control District Section III (IFCD 3) in 1983. This was crucial because the area lies within the Trinity River floodplain, making it susceptible to flooding. IFCD 3 was instrumental in designing and constructing an extensive levee system, along with waterways and other infrastructure, to protect the community from flooding and eliminate the need for costly federal flood insurance for property owners.\n\nHistorically, Valley Ranch was also home to the practice facilities for the Dallas Cowboys football team (starting in 1985) and the Dallas Stars hockey team; both teams have since relocated to Frisco, Texas.\n\n**Valley Ranch in Porter, Texas**\nThe Valley Ranch community in Porter, Texas, began its development around 2006. This 1,400-acre master-planned community is situated at the intersection of Interstate 69 (US Highway 59) and The Grand Parkway (99) in Northeast Montgomery County, near Houston.\n\nThe vision for Valley Ranch in Porter was to create a comprehensive mixed-use community. The development has seen its single-family residential component fully built out, with multi-family residences like The Villas at Valley Ranch opening in 2008 and The Pointe at Valley Ranch Town Center in 2019. A significant feature is the 240-acre Valley Ranch Town Center, which offers extensive shopping, dining, and entertainment options. The community also includes The Grove, a 135-acre nature preserve featuring lakes and forested trails, and various civic amenities such as the New Caney ISD Randall Reed Stadium."
